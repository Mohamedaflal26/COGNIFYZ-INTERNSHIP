# COGNIFYZ PROJECTS

1. Location Based Analysis:

   
This project performs a geographical analysis of restaurant data using Python, primarily leveraging the GeoPandas library. The dataset includes information about restaurants, such as their locations (longitude and latitude), ratings, and price ranges. Key features of the project include:

Visualizing the geographic distribution of restaurants on a world map, focusing on cities in Asia.
Plotting the number of restaurants per city, highlighting the top 20 cities with the most restaurants.
Analyzing average restaurant ratings by city, presenting the top-rated cities.
Examining average price ranges of restaurants across different cities.
The project is designed to identify trends and insights based on the location of restaurants, facilitating decisions about popular areas and pricing strategies.

2. Suggestion Based on Restaurant Rating:

   
This project focuses on predicting restaurant ratings based on various features of the dataset using machine learning models. The dataset includes attributes like locality, cuisines, and booking options. Key steps include:

Data preprocessing: Label encoding is used for categorical variables.
Model training: Several regression models are trained, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Performance evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to identify the best-performing model.
Feature importance: The project identifies the most important features influencing restaurant ratings using the Random Forest model.
This project aims to provide recommendations by predicting restaurant ratings based on various factors, enhancing decision-making for restaurant owners or users.
